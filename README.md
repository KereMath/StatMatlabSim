Implement a Matlab/Octave code that does this simulation. As the size of the simulation use your
answer in part a of Q1. In your report provide the following;
• Estimate the probability that the total weight of all the vehicles that pass over the bridge on a day
is more than 200 tons.
• Estimate the total weight, X, of all the vehicles that pass over the bridge on a day.
• Estimate Std(X) and comment on the accuracy of your estimator of X
